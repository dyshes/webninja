# webninja
Hi, everyone! This repository is dedicated to the tool I created and named WebNinja. I hope it will be useful for programmers of any kind who are interested in 
data gathering/web automation without having to worry about writing a lot of code. This is a wrapper for popular python libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup and
Selenium. Instead of directly writing code, you could write up a JSON file containing commands and pass that file to the command parser to view and interact with
any website.
